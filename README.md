## Investigation Methodology

While scrolling through social media, I came across an advertisement promoting extremely cheap devices‚Äîsuch as a Galaxy Fold for just ‚Çπ500‚Äîwhich immediately raised suspicion. Upon visiting the site, I noticed several red flags, including an insecure payment gateway.

To further investigate, I performed a series of DNS queries:

- `nslookup xoofi.shop`
- `nslookup -type=NS xoofi.shop`
- Queries against various root DNS servers like `shop.a.root-servers.net` and `xoofi.shop b.gmoregistry.net`, choosing the root DNS server geographically closest to me for better accuracy. 

From these queries, I identified two prominent IP addresses:  
- **37.209.194.4**  
- **82.25.120.19**

I then used `whois` and `nslookup` on these IPs to gather information about their registrants and hosting providers.  

Next, I took screenshots of the site and downloaded the QR code the site urged users to scan. This QR code was analyzed in a sealed, safe environment to check for any embedded malicious code or payloads.

I generated IOC hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) for the QR file, created a detailed forensic report, and contacted the abuse contacts found in the WHOIS records for both the domain and IP ranges.

After reporting, the fraudulent site was shut down by the hosting providers within approximately 10 minutes.
